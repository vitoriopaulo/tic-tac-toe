# tic-tac-toe-game
Repo for the 1st project developed in the GA WDI class20.

This is the very first full-stack project undergoing development in the GA WDI class20 Web Development Immersive Bootcamp Boston.

Technologies used: HTML5, Css, Scss, Javascript, Jquery, ajax.

Concept: The application has an interface theme inspired in the world of childhood: colorful, ludic, playful.

It was designed to have its UX | UI conceptually strong: a product that expect to not only meet the basics requirement of a simple interface to play the game but make use of visual design to make the end user interested to use the application by its unique visual design appeal. As such, a Tic-Tac-Toe-Game
web application built to stand out in the crowd.

The navigation in the web application was thought to be as simple, elegant and visually pleasant as possible: the end user interacts with the application in three levels of navigation. In the first level, the web user makes the sign-up and sign-in in the home page.

After the sign in, the web user is directed to the second level of navigation: here, the user is directed to the third and last level of navigation by clicking in the New Game botton. This action will create the very first game and launch the game board. After that, he's allowed to play as much games as wanted.

Finally, the end user can change his password if want or logout from the application, returning back to the first level of navigation (Home page) where the Sign-in and Sign-up is displayed.

The following url shows the skectched wireframes that explains the flow of usage of the application. It helps to visualize the concept behind the creation of the front-end of the api:

In regards to the back-end of the application, it has some pending matters that will be troubleshooted throughout the program:
1) Related to the game-logic:
Game logic acceptance of the result only as a Draw if game ends in the ninth click. Game is not allowing player X to win the game on the ninth click. This specific part of the Code needs to be reviewed and trobleshooted.

1) Related to the game-api:
Functionality of updating the created game, move by move by the end user while the game is being played,  is pending. Functionality related to the retrieval of the statistics of the game (total games played) to be displayed in the UI of the api pending.
This two specific part of the code related to the back-end of the application needs to be troubleshooted as well.

The working in progress web aplication in beta-testing status has already been deployed and is hosted on my personal Github pages account. Url follows:
