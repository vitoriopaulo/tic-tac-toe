# tic-tac-toe-game
Repo for the 1st project developed in the GA WDI class20.

This is the very first full-stack project undergoing development in the GA WDI class20 Web Development Immersive Bootcamp Boston. 

Technologies used: HTML5, Css, Scss, Javascript, Jquery, ajax.

Concept: The application has an interface theme inspired in the world of childhood: colorful, ludic, playful. 
It was designed to have its UX | UI conceptually strong: a product that expect to not only meet the basics requirement of an
interface to play the game but make use of visual design to seduce the end user and make the end user tempted to use the application.

The navigation in the web application was thought to be as simple and pleasant as possible: in the first level of navigation,
the web user makes the sign-up and sign-in.

After the sign in, the web user is directed to the second level of navigation: here, he's directed to the third and last level of 
navigation by clicking in the New Game botton. After that, he's allowed to play as much games as he wants.

Finally, he can change his password if want or logout from the application, returning back to the first level of navigation 
Sign-in and Sign-up.

The following url shows the wireframe of skectched to the application. It helps to visualize the concept behind the creation

1) Related to the game-logic:
Game logic acceptance of the result as a Draw pending; 

1) Related to the game-api:
Functionality of updating the created game, move by move by the end user while the game is being played, in the server, is pending.
